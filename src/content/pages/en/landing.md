### Headline:
**Your child's eyes deserve your attention.**

### Subheadline:
A free, evidence-based guide to children's eye health — written for parents, not doctors.

### Brief description:
Most childhood eye problems show no obvious signs. Children rarely tell you they can't see well — because they don't know what "normal" looks like. This site helps you know what to watch for, when to get your child's eyes checked, and what to do if something is found.

Every article is backed by published medical research, reviewed for accuracy, and written in language you can actually understand.

### Call to action buttons:
- **Start Reading** → links to the category page or Article 3 (Signs of Vision Problems)
- **Eye Exam Schedule** → links to Article 7

## "Why This Site Exists" Section

Every year, children lose vision that could have been saved — simply because no one knew what to look for.

A white glow in a baby's pupil that turned out to be eye cancer. A "lazy eye" discovered too late for treatment. A child struggling in school because they couldn't see the board — and nobody realized it.

These aren't rare stories. They happen in families everywhere.

This site was created to change that. We believe every parent — whether expecting their first child or raising their third — deserves access to clear, trustworthy information about their children's eye health. Not medical jargon. Not scary statistics without context. Just honest, evidence-based guidance that helps you protect your child's vision.

**We are not doctors.** But every fact on this site comes from published textbooks, peer-reviewed research, and official guidelines from organizations like the World Health Organization, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the UK's NHS, Japan's Ophthalmologists Association, and Singapore's Health Promotion Board.

If something on this site helps you catch a problem early — or simply gives you peace of mind — then it's done its job.
