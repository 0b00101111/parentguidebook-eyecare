# About This Project

## Our Mission

eyecare.parentguidebook.org exists for one reason: to help parents protect their children's eyes.

We believe that every parent — regardless of where they live, what language they speak, or what they can afford — should have access to clear, accurate, and trustworthy information about children's eye health.

Too many childhood eye problems are caught late — not because treatments don't exist, but because parents didn't know what to look for. A child with amblyopia ("lazy eye") doesn't know they can't see well. A baby with a cataract looks normal from the outside. A white glow in a photo might be dismissed as a camera glitch.

This site is here to close that knowledge gap.

## How Our Content Is Created

Every article on this site follows a strict process:

1. **Research.** We review published textbooks, peer-reviewed academic papers, and official clinical guidelines from recognized medical organizations. We do not rely on blogs, forums, or anonymous online sources.

2. **Writing.** Articles are written in plain, accessible language. Medical terms are always explained in simple words first, with the technical term provided alongside for reference. We aim for a tone that is warm, supportive, and honest — never condescending or fear-mongering.

3. **Source citation.** Every factual claim is tied to a specific source, listed at the bottom of each article. We include direct links where available so you can verify anything yourself.

4. **International perspective.** We reference guidelines from multiple regions — including the World Health Organization (WHO), the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), the UK National Health Service (NHS), Japan's ophthalmological associations, Singapore's Health Promotion Board, and health authorities in China, Taiwan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Our regional comparison tables help you find information relevant to where you live.

5. **Bilingual.** Every article is available in both English and Chinese. The Chinese versions are written to read naturally — not as mechanical translations.

6. **Emotional care.** We understand that reading about your child's health can be frightening. Our articles address common fears directly, remove blame and guilt, and always remind parents that early detection is a success, not a failure.

## What This Site Is Not

- **We are not a medical provider.** We do not diagnose conditions, prescribe treatments, or replace professional medical advice.
- **We are not affiliated with any hospital, clinic, pharmaceutical company, or eyewear brand.** We have no financial conflicts of interest.
- **We do not display advertisements** or sell products of any kind.
- **We do not collect personal data** beyond what is needed to deliver our newsletter (if you choose to subscribe).

## Who Is Behind This

This project was created by a parent who, while reading about children's eye health, realized that this information should be more accessible to every family. The site is built and maintained as a non-profit educational resource.

We welcome feedback, corrections, and suggestions from parents, educators, and medical professionals. If you notice an error, have a suggestion for a new topic, or would like to contribute a translation into another language, please reach out.
