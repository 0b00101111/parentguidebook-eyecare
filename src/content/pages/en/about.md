# Parent Guidebook · 养育有方

A free, bilingual guide to raising a whole, healthy, resilient child and caring for all your loved ones.

---

## Why This Exists

When our daughter had adenoid hypertrophy, we spent months figuring out what to do—and we had the language skills and time to search. A friend’s daughter didn’t get glasses until she was 10 because her parents didn’t know what to look for. After immigrating from China to Canada, we kept running into the same gap: trustworthy, practical guidance in two languages was hard to find.

These experiences are common. Parent Guidebook / 养育有方 exists to change that. We want every parent to have access to clear, evidence-based information in their own language—so they can care for their children and their families with confidence.

## What It Is

Parent Guidebook is a comprehensive, evidence-based, bilingual (English and Chinese) resource covering every major domain of raising a child and caring for loved ones. Every article is backed by published medical research and official guidelines, written in plain language, and designed to both educate and emotionally support the reader.

**Core principles:** Evidence-based. Bilingual. Emotionally supportive. Culturally respectful. Practically actionable. Free forever.

## What It Covers

We organize content into four areas. More domains are added over time.

- **For the Body** — Eyes (8 articles, live now: vision screening, strabismus, myopia, eye exams). Coming: Breathing, Bones & Movement, Teeth, Nutrition.
- **For the Mind** — Attention & Digital World, Learning & Cognitive, Social & Emotional, School Life.
- **For Daily Life** — Physical Activity, Outdoor Life, Home Environment.
- **For the Heart & Soul** — Identity & Belonging, Gender & Confidence & Equality, Character & Inner Strength, Adaptability & Transitions, Big Questions, Explore & Future Readiness, How the World Works.

Eyes is the first domain we’ve published. Others are in progress.

## How Our Content Is Created

Every article follows a strict process: research from textbooks, peer-reviewed papers, and official guidelines; writing in plain language with medical terms explained; source citations at the bottom of each article; an international perspective (WHO, regional health authorities); bilingual versions written to read naturally; and emotional care—addressing fears and reminding parents that early detection is a success, not a failure.

## The Bigger Vision — 有方 Across a Lifetime

The brand 有方 (yǒu fāng) carries three meanings from classical Chinese, each mapping to a stage of caregiving:

- **养育有方** — Raising children well **(now)**
- **游必有方** — Caring for aging parents with clear direction **(future)**
- **相处有方** — Being with your partner well **(future)**

## Our Commitment

- **Free forever.** All educational content, the website, and the reading experience will never be behind a paywall.
- **No ads. No data selling.** We don’t monetize attention or privacy.
- **Evidence-based.** Every claim cites published research. We correct errors promptly.
- **Bilingual from day one.** English and Chinese, both written naturally, not translated mechanically.
- **Built by parents, for parents.** We build what we wish had existed when our daughter was born.

## Who Is Behind This

This project was created by parents who wanted trustworthy, bilingual guidance for raising a whole, healthy child—and for caring for the whole family over time. The site is built and maintained as a non-profit educational resource.
