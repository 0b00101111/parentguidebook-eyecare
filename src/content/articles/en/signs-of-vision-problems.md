# My Child Seems to Not See Well — Signs of Vision Problems by Age

**⏱️ Quick Summary (30 seconds)**

🟡 **Urgency: Most signs below are worth bringing up at your next doctor visit. Signs marked with 🔴 need prompt attention.**

**The key thing to remember:** Children rarely tell you they can't see well — because they don't know what "normal" vision is. Watch for their behavior, not their complaints.

**Quick checklist — see a doctor if your child:**
- 🔴 Has a white, gray, or yellow spot in the pupil ([read more](/en/emergency-signs/white-pupil/))
- 🔴 Has eyes that consistently point in different directions after 4 months of age
- Can't follow a moving toy with their eyes by 3 months old
- Squints, tilts their head, or closes one eye to see
- Sits very close to the TV or holds things very close to their face
- Rubs their eyes a lot (when not sleepy)
- Avoids reading, drawing, or close-up activities
- Complains of headaches or tired eyes
- Seems clumsy or bumps into things more than other children their age

**What to do:** Mention any of these to your child's doctor. Most are easily checked and many are easily treated — especially when caught early.

## Why this article exists

Here's something that's hard for parents to hear but important to understand: **a child who can't see well usually won't tell you.** Not because they're hiding it, but because they genuinely don't know. If they've always seen the world blurry through one eye, that's just how the world looks to them. They have nothing to compare it to. [Source: src1]

This means that as a parent, you need to know what to watch for — the behavioral clues that something might not be right. Many of these signs are subtle. Some of them could easily be mistaken for other things (shyness, clumsiness, short attention span, even behavioral problems). That's why having a guide organized by age can help.

**An important reassurance before we begin:** Noticing one or two of these signs doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. Children are quirky — some sit close to the TV just because they like it, some tilt their heads out of habit. But if you notice a pattern, or if something just feels "off" to you as a parent, trust that feeling and get it checked. You know your child better than anyone. [Source: src5]

## Newborns (0–3 months)

At this age, your baby is just beginning to develop the ability to see. Their vision is blurry — they can focus on objects only about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) away, which happens to be about the distance from your face to theirs when you're holding them. They see mostly in high contrast (light and dark), and their color vision is still developing. [Source: src2]

**What's normal:**
- Eyes that occasionally wander or cross — this is common in the first 2-3 months because the muscles that control eye movement are still learning to work together. [Source: src2]
- Blinking or turning away from bright lights — their eyes are sensitive. [Source: src7]
- Seeming to stare at nothing — they're actually taking in their blurry new world. [Source: src7]

**Watch for (talk to your doctor if you see these):**
- 🔴 **A white, gray, or yellow glow in the pupil** — this is always urgent. See our [white pupil article](/en/emergency-signs/white-pupil/). [Source: src8]
- **No response to bright light at all** — no blinking, no pupil getting smaller. [Source: src1]
- **Not looking at your face at all by 6-8 weeks** — by this age, most babies start to briefly focus on faces, especially during feeding. [Source: src2]
- **Constant, persistent eye crossing or wandering** (not occasional) — if one eye seems to always turn in or out, mention it. [Source: src1]
- **Excessive tearing or crusty discharge** that doesn't go away — this could be a blocked tear duct (very common, usually resolves on its own) or an infection. [Source: src8]
- **Eyes that appear very different in size**, or a droopy eyelid that covers the pupil. [Source: src8]

> **For new parents feeling anxious:** It's completely normal to worry about your newborn's eyes. The fact that their eyes wander and seem unfocused in the first weeks can be alarming — but this is a normal part of development. Their little eye muscles are brand new and still learning. Give it time, and by about 3 months, things should start to come together. If something feels genuinely wrong to you, though, don't hesitate to ask your doctor. There is no such thing as a silly question when it comes to your baby's health.

## Infants (3–12 months)

This is when vision develops rapidly. By about 3 months, your baby should be able to follow a moving object with their eyes. By 5 months, they're developing depth perception — the ability to tell how far away things are. By 8-9 months, their vision is clear enough to recognize people across a room. [Sources: src2, src7]

**What's normal:**
- Eyes that now move together smoothly and follow things. [Source: src2]
- Reaching for objects, especially brightly colored ones. [Source: src7]
- Fascination with their own hands. [Source: src7]
- Eye color may still be changing (usually settles by 6-9 months). [Source: src2]

**Watch for (talk to your doctor if you see these):**
- 🔴 **Eyes still crossing or wandering after 4 months** — occasional crossing before this is normal, but after 4 months, one eye consistently turning in or out is a sign that needs checking. This could indicate strabismus (misaligned eyes), which affects about 2-5% of children. [Sources: src1, src3]
- **Not following a moving toy or your face with their eyes by 3 months.** [Source: src1]
- **Not reaching for objects by 5-6 months** — while this can have many causes, it could be related to vision. [Source: src7]
- **One eye that seems to "lag behind" the other** when looking at things. [Source: src9]
- **Consistently tilting or turning their head** to look at you or at toys. [Source: src3]
- **Extreme sensitivity to indoor light** (not just sunlight — squinting even in normal room lighting). [Source: src8]
- **Persistent tearing from one eye** beyond 6 months. [Source: src8]

> **If your baby's eyes still seem to cross sometimes:** Many parents worry about this, and it can be hard to tell whether it's real or just how the baby's face looks. Some babies have a wide, flat bridge of the nose that makes their eyes look crossed even when they're perfectly aligned — this is called pseudostrabismus (the "pseudo" means "false"), and it's harmless. Your doctor can tell the difference with a simple test using a small light. If you're not sure, ask — it's always better to check. [Source: src9]

## Toddlers (1–3 years)

Toddlers are busy exploring the world, and they use their vision constantly — but they still can't tell you if something is wrong. About 10% of preschool-age children have some kind of eye or vision problem, and most of them are completely unaware of it. [Source: src5]

**What's normal:**
- Recognizing familiar people and objects. [Source: src7]
- Pointing at things they want you to see. [Source: src7]
- Scribbling with crayons, stacking blocks, placing shapes into holes. [Source: src7]
- Good hand-eye coordination for their age. [Source: src7]

**Watch for:**
- **Sitting very close to the TV** or holding picture books right up against their face. [Source: src5]
- **Rubbing their eyes a lot** when they're not sleepy — this could mean eye strain. [Source: src3]
- **Squinting or partially closing their eyes** to look at things. [Source: src5]
- **Tilting their head to one side** when looking at something in front of them — they may be trying to find an angle where they can see more clearly. This can be a sign of astigmatism (where the eye doesn't bend light evenly) or a muscle imbalance. [Sources: src3, src5]
- **Covering or closing one eye** — they may be doing this because one eye sees much worse than the other. [Source: src5]
- **Bumping into things or tripping more than seems typical** — this could be related to depth perception issues. [Source: src5]
- **Seeming clumsy with hand-eye activities** like catching a ball, pouring water, or putting shapes in the right holes. [Source: src5]
- **Sensitivity to light.** [Source: src5]
- **An eye that turns inward or outward** — strabismus can develop at this age even if the eyes were fine as an infant. [Source: src3]

> **"But my toddler sits close to the TV and seems fine..."** Maybe they are fine — lots of toddlers just like being close to things. But if this is combined with other signs on this list (squinting, head tilting, rubbing eyes), it's worth getting checked. A simple eye exam can give you peace of mind or catch something early. [Source: src5]

## Preschoolers (3–5 years)

This age is critically important because it's when **amblyopia** (often called "lazy eye") can still be effectively treated. Amblyopia is when one eye doesn't develop normal vision — the brain starts ignoring it. If caught before age 6-7, treatment is usually simple and very effective. If missed, the vision loss in that eye can become permanent. [Sources: src3, src9]

**Watch for:**
- Everything listed for toddlers above, plus:
- **Difficulty recognizing colors, letters, or numbers** compared to other children their age — while this can have many causes, vision should be ruled out first. [Source: src5]
- **Short attention span for age-appropriate activities** — a child who can't see well may lose interest quickly in visual tasks like coloring, puzzles, or picture books. This is sometimes mistaken for an attention disorder. [Sources: src4, src5]
- **Avoiding drawing, coloring, or looking at books** — they might be avoiding these because it's uncomfortable, not because they're not interested. [Source: src4]
- **Difficulty catching or throwing a ball** that other children their age can manage. [Source: src5]
- **Complaints of headaches, tired eyes, or dizziness** after visual tasks. [Source: src6]
- **"My eyes are itchy" or "my eyes feel scratchy"** — while often caused by allergies, persistent discomfort should be checked. [Source: src6]

> **A note about attention and behavior:** It's worth pausing here. Some children who seem to have trouble concentrating, who seem "lazy" about schoolwork, or who avoid reading aren't actually struggling with attention or motivation — they're struggling to see. A child who can't focus on a book because the words are blurry will naturally look away, fidget, or lose interest. Before assuming a behavioral problem, rule out a vision problem. An eye exam takes less than an hour and can change everything. [Source: src4]

> **And if your child does have a vision problem:** this is not because you did something wrong. It is not because of too much screen time, not enough vegetables, or any parenting choice. Most childhood vision problems are developmental or genetic. The fact that you noticed the signs and are reading this article already makes you exactly the parent your child needs.

## School-age children (6–12 years)

At this age, children can start to tell you about some problems — but they still often don't, because they assume everyone sees the way they do. This is the age when **myopia (nearsightedness)** most commonly appears and progresses. [Source: src2]

**Watch for:**
- **Squinting to see the board at school** or asking to sit in the front row. [Source: src4]
- **Holding books or screens very close to their face.** [Source: src4]
- **Losing their place when reading,** or using a finger to keep track of lines. [Source: src4]
- **Avoiding reading or homework** — not because they don't want to, but because it's physically uncomfortable. [Source: src4]
- **Frequent headaches,** especially after school or after reading. [Source: src6]
- **Declining grades or changing behavior at school** that doesn't have another clear explanation. [Source: src4]
- **Turning their head to the side** when looking at something in front of them. [Source: src3]
- **Rubbing their eyes or blinking excessively** after close work. [Source: src3]
- **Complaints that words "move" or "swim" on the page.** [Source: src6]
- **Saying things look blurry or seeing double.** [Source: src6]

> **If your child needs glasses:** Please read the section below carefully.

## Teenagers (13–18 years)

Teens can tell you about their vision, but they might not — out of embarrassment, not wanting to be different, or simply not realizing that what they see isn't normal.

**Watch for:**
- All of the school-age signs above, plus:
- **Increased squinting when looking at distant objects** — myopia often continues to progress during teenage years. [Source: src3]
- **Eye strain, dry eyes, or headaches from screen use.** [Source: src3]
- **Difficulty seeing at night** (especially while learning to drive). [Source: src6]
- **Avoiding sports or activities** that require good distance vision. [Source: src4]
- **Changes in school performance** without a clear cause. [Source: src4]

## A special note about glasses

If you've been told your child needs glasses, you might feel a range of emotions — worry, guilt, sadness, even grief. Many parents do. We want to address a few things directly:

**"Is it my fault my child needs glasses?"** Almost certainly not. Nearsightedness (the most common reason children need glasses) is primarily influenced by genetics and the normal growth of the eye. It is not caused by letting your child watch too much TV, use too many screens, or read in dim light. These factors may play a small role in how quickly myopia progresses, but they are not the root cause. You did not fail your child.

**"Will wearing glasses make my child's eyes worse?"** No. This is one of the most common misconceptions about children's vision. Properly prescribed glasses do NOT make eyesight deteriorate. What happens is that myopia often progresses naturally during the childhood growth years — it would happen with or without glasses. Without glasses, the same progression occurs, but the child also can't see clearly, which affects their learning, their confidence, and their daily life. Glasses are a tool that helps your child see the world clearly. They are not a sign that something went wrong.

**"My child doesn't want to wear glasses."** This is very common, especially at first. Children may worry about being teased or looking different. Here's what can help: let them choose frames they love (this makes a huge difference), point out role models who wear glasses (teachers, athletes, characters in shows), and most importantly — normalize it. "Your eyes just need a little help to see clearly. That's completely okay. Lots of people wear glasses, and you look great in them."

**Remember to tell your child:** This is not their fault either. Their eyes are not "broken." They didn't do anything wrong. Their eyes are just shaped in a way that needs a little help focusing, and that's perfectly normal.

## When to see a doctor immediately

While most signs on this page are worth bringing up at your next scheduled visit, some need faster action:

- 🔴 **A white, gray, or yellow glow in the pupil** — see our [white pupil article](/en/emergency-signs/white-pupil/). Days, not weeks.
- 🔴 **Sudden onset of eye crossing or turning** in a child whose eyes were previously straight.
- 🔴 **Sudden loss of vision or severe pain** in one or both eyes.
- 🔴 **Eye injury** — any impact to the eye area, especially if there's pain, swelling, or change in vision.
- 🔴 **A bulging eye** — one eye that looks larger or appears to stick out more than the other.

For these, contact an eye doctor or go to the emergency department the same day. [Sources: src3, src8]
